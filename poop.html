		<h1>Whats not sensory but intellectual and deductive?</h1>

				Well, you just need to read this awesome article.

		<h3 class="eco"> What's Empiricism</h3>
			<p>
				In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience.[1] It is one of several views of epistemology, the study of human knowledge, along with rationalism and skepticism. Empiricism emphasises the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, over the idea of innate ideas or traditions.[2] However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.SO WHAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE?
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li id="epo">
					   Empiricism is Simpler:  Compared to Empiricism, Rationalism has one more entity that exists:  Innate knowledge.  According to the Empiricist, the innate knowledge is unobservable and inefficacious; that is, it does not do anything.  The knowledge may sit there, never being used.  Using Ockham’s Razor (= when deciding between competing theories that explain the same phenomena, the simpler theory is better),1 Empiricism is the better theory. Math and Logic are Innate:  Doesn’t it seem that mathematical and logical truths are true not because of our five senses, but because of reason’s ability to connect ideas?
					</li>

				       Imagination and Experience:  How can we get the idea of perfect triangularity?  We can extrapolate from our experience with crooked, sensible triangles and use our imagination to straighten out what is crooked and see what perfect triangularity is.
					 </li>

				</ul>

			<p>
				 I have recently seen an episode of "Through the Wormhole" with God, I mean, Morgan Freeman, and scientists have apparently discovered that, even in a vaccum, there are some sort of subatomic particles there, so there is no such thing as nothing, or that even nothing is something.
